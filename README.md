# ðŸš— ParkEasy

ParkEasy is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users find available parking lots in Singapore, sorted by distance or availability, using real-time data from government-provided APIs and Google Maps API. The app offers two main views: a list view of parking lots and a map view. Users can also click on a parking lot to get directions via Google Maps.

## Features

- **Real-time Parking Lot Data:** Retrieves and displays parking lot availability and distance using Singapore's government-provided API.
- **Sorting Options:** Sort parking lots based on proximity or availability.
- **List View & Map View:** Offers two views for displaying resultsâ€”either as a list or on a map with interactive pins.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Easily navigate to a selected parking lot through Google Maps.
- **Dynamic Search Radius:** Users can adjust the search radius for parking lots, up to 5 km.

## System Overview

ParkEasy is designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, ensuring modularity and scalability:

	â€¢	Model: Manages data such as parking lot availability, locations, and user input.
	â€¢	View: Handles UI components like list views and map views for displaying car parks.
	â€¢	Controller: Processes user inputs (e.g., sorting, searching) and updates the model and view accordingly.

The app retrieves parking lot data via APIs from Singaporeâ€™s government and integrates Google Maps API for geolocation and navigation.

## Key Components

	â€¢	CarParkManager: Manages car park data and sorts it by user preferences (distance or availability).
	â€¢	ListView & MapView: Allow users to toggle between different views of parking data.
	â€¢	GoogleAPI Integration: Fetches location suggestions and navigation routes using Google Maps.

## Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure the latest version of Flutter SDK is installed ([flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev)).
- **Google Maps API Key**: A Google Maps API key is required to enable map view and navigation.
- **Singapore Govt API Key**: An API that provides real-time car-park usage details ([Link](https://data.gov.sg/collections/1484/view))
